## Some things to know about me:

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the time when my punk rock band T.4t was gigging around NYC.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

## âš¡ Fun fact: My Software Engineering principles are:

### T - Test often

### U - Understand the problem

### R - Research is key (a.k.a. Google it!)

### T - Teamwork makes the dream work!

### L - Listen and Learn

### E - Even if I fail, I grow and that makes it worth the time.
